                                ELKS TO-DO LIST
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of things that need to be completed before we can realistically
release the stated kernel versions. If you see anything missing, please add it
at the appropriate point in this list.

===============================================================================

 *  Before 0.1.0 is released:

    *	Ensure parallel and serial drivers work, even if some of their
	functionality is missing.

    *	Reduce code size.

 *  Before 0.2.0 is released:

    *	Complete and test parallel drivers.

    *	Complete and test serial drivers.

    *	Ensure ELKS is fully ROMable and embeddable.

    *	Modify interrupt code to save DS in VII rather than in kernel data
	segment.

    *	PLIP networking support.

    *	Reduce code size.

    *	Rewrite exec and device code to be able to run without file systems.

    *	Simplify device request functions as they can only be asked to get
	one block at a time.

    *	Thoroughly test all supported file systems, ensuring they are stable
	under every level of load that we can place on them.

    *	Working support for 286 processors.

 *  Before 1.0.0 is released.

    *	Reduce code size.

    *	Support for ethernet adapters, including the NE1000, NE2000 and
	WD8003 adapters.

    *	Support for usermode AX.25 networking node and BBS system.

===============================================================================

Also included here are things we would like to see on an ELKS-based
system, but which are not specific to the ELKS kernel or project itself:

    *	ELKS-based DNS server.

    *	ELKS-based FTP server.

    *	ELKS-based HTTP server.

    *	openssh

    *	screen

Other items may be added in future.
