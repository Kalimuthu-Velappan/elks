TODO
----

This is firstly a list of things that need to be done for 0.1, and then a list
of more general things. Please let me know what you think should be in here.

Complete and test serial and parallel drivers.

Debug filesystem.

Reduce code size.

Re-write wait queues so they don't sit on the kernel stack, but sit on the task
structure instead.

Simplify device request functions as they can only be asked to get 1 block.

Modify interrupt code to save ds in VII rather than in kernel data segment.
Re-write exec and device code to run without filesystem. Generally make ELKS
ROMable and embedable.

Fix select.
