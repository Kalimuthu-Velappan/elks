                                ELKS TO-DO LIST
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of things that need to be completed before we can realistically
release the stated kernel versions. If you see anything missing, please add it
at the appropriate point in this list.

===============================================================================

 *  Before 0.2.0 is released:

    *	Complete the ANSI'fication of the source tree.

    *	Ensure all configuration tools produce EXACTLY the same .config
	files, including comments therein.

    *	Ensure ELKS is fully ROMable and embeddable.

    *	Ensure the parallel and serial drivers work, even if some of their
	functionality is missing.

    *	Reduce code size.

    *	Rewrite exec and device code to be able to run without file systems.

    *	Simplify device request functions as they can only be asked to get
	one block at a time.

    *	Thoroughly test all supported file systems, ensuring they are stable
	under every level of load that we can place on them.

 *  Before 0.3.0 is released:

    *	Complete and test parallel drivers.

    *	Complete and test serial drivers.

    *	Modify interrupt code to save DS in VII rather than in kernel data
	segment. (Whatever this means - anybody care to explain?)

    *	PLIP networking support.

    *	Reduce code size.

    *	Working support for 286 processors.

 *  Before 1.0.0 is released.

    *	Reduce code size.

    *	Support for ethernet adapters, including the NE1000, NE2000 and
	WD8003 adapters.

    *	Support for usermode AX.25 networking node and bulletin boards.

===============================================================================

Also included here are things we would like to see on an ELKS-based system, but
which are not specific to the ELKS kernel or project itself:

    *	ELKS-based DNS server.

    *	ELKS-based FTP server.

    *	ELKS-based HTTP server capable of handling non-static pages. It is
	noted that a web server capable only of handling static pages can
	be obtained from Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@gmx.net> who demonstrated
	it on the Internet in late November 2001.

    *	ELKS-based print server software.

    *	openssh

    *	screen

Other items may be added in future as requested. Please address any wish-list
requests to Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name> for inclusion herein.
