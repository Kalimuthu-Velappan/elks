The boot and root images are gzipped in this directory... however the root
image, although 360K, did not work correctly this time (maybe I should mkfs
it on a real floppy first :) possibly because of the doshd detection code...
They work fine under dosemu though.

I'm a bit of a random hacker, so what I actually wind up doing could be
completely different from what I put on the TODO list... :)
