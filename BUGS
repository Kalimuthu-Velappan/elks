The interrupt routine for the serial driver rs_irq() is currently not called 
when the serial port should be generating an interrupt. It is not clear why,
but it is probable there is a bug somewhere in the serial port configuration
code

Sometimes unmounting a non-root filesystem returns EBUSY when nothing is using,
and nothing seems to rectify it.

Sometimes for no aparent reason the umount command gives a STACK collided with
BSS error without unmounting the filesystem.
