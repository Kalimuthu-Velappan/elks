Plans for development of the ANSI video driver

===============================================================================

At the moment, there is a VT52 driver included in the kernel. I plan to
start by abstracting this out into a separate usermode driver that talks
to the kernel to perform the required functions, and also to register
itself as an available video driver.

Note that the ansi.c driver in this directory is written for GCC and not
BCC. This is simply so I can use prototypes to ensure the function calls
match what the functions expect whilst I am developing it. I require it to
compile without either errors or warnings using...

	gcc -Wall -pedantic -o ansi ansi.c

...before I will accept it.
