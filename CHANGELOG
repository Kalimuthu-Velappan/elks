	* Added user timeout to TCP/IP.

Mon Nov 26 15:19:36 EET 2001 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed back the fixed sys_lseek(). It seems that libc expects
	  the return value to be passed through one of the parameters.

Fri Nov 24 02:31:18 EET 2001 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.0-pre2 !!!

Fri Nov 23 19:34:28 EET 2001 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed sys_lseek() to correctly return the resulting offset
	  location.
	* Made inet aware of CONFIG_SOCK_CLIENTONLY.

Fri Nov 23 02:32:35 EET 2001 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed zero tcp window issues
	* Fixed do_fork(). It was not freeing the previously
	  allocated code segment when the allocation of the
	  data segment was failing.

Wed Nov 21 01:37:32 EET 2001 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Removed unused config variable CONFIG_IBMPC_RAINBOW pending any
	  decision on whether to port to this system.
	* Verified that all standard make commands now work using the
	  standardised ruleset.

Sun Nov 18 18:55:53 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* All temporary files now have *.tmp format names.
	* Created new `setdir` script to simplify the `make dist` command.
	  This gets rid of a nasty bug.
	* If `make dep` and `make nodep` find that the resulting Makefile
	  is unchanged, they retain it.
	* Moved `make dist` dir to be under the same directory that the ELKS
	  base directory is under rather than under the ELKS base directory
	  itself.
	* Verified that all config variable renames stated in this CHANGELOG
	  document had actually been committed to the CVS archive.

Sat Nov 17 18:03:45 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.90 !!!

Sat Nov 17 18:03:45 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed bug in `make dist` - it missed an important file out!

Sat Nov 17 12:14:01 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Tweaked config variables as follows:

		CONFIG_BE_KEYMAP	CONFIG_KEYMAP_BE

	* Fixed bug in `make dist` that stopped it from working.

Fri Nov 16 09:28:55 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Created testing commands in elks/Makefile:

	    make me	Creates a test copy of the current tree.
			This is NOT the same as `make dist`.

	    make set	Displays a list of all environment variables
			as currently set.

	    make test	Performs `make defconfig` to create a config
			identical to the default configuration, then
			runs through all of the standard non-config
			commands to ensure they all work.

	* Updated TODO document.

Wed Nov 14 13:26:39 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.89 !!!

	* ELKS now compiles with the SAME compilation commands throughout!
	  Rationalisation of the ELKS makefiles is complete as a result.

Tue Nov 13 23:57:42 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed stupid typos in previous bugfix !!!
	* Stopped `make Image` from doing infinite recursion !!!

Tue Nov 13 23:52:18 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed bug in elks/Makefile that stopped compiles- I'd missed a
	  dependency :(

Tue Nov 13 17:40:00 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Renamed config vars as follows:

		CONFIG_ARCH_PC		CONFIG_ARCH_IBMPC

		CONFIG_ROM_IS186	CONFIG_CPU_80186
		CONFIG_ROM_IS286	CONFIG_CPU_80286
		CONFIG_ROM_IS386	CONFIG_CPU_80386
		CONFIG_ROM_IS486	CONFIG_CPU_80486
		CONFIG_ROM_IS86 	CONFIG_CPU_8086

Mon Nov 12 14:05:37 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Corrected faulty ASM comment markers to remove unnecessary display
	  of assembly comments.

Sun Nov 11 19:50:43 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reverted change that moved definition of UTS_RELEASE to command
	  line as this resulted in the command line being too long. This is
	  still a work in progress, not yet 100% complete.

Sun Nov 11 12:35:14 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fix in inet_write().
	* Fixed case when a process writes to a closed pipe from the other
	  end of the connection. Now returns EPIPE.
	* Fixes in the tcp state machine concerning LAST_ACK state.
	* More "RFC" behavior of inet_read(). 

Sat Nov 10 18:27:17 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Made System.map sorted by address.
	* Replaced tabs with spaces on the contributor list at the top of
	  CHANGELOG file. This make's it readable from everyone, whatever
	  tab width someone uses.
	* Better tcp ISN selection.

Sat Nov 10 00:05:18 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Did some more fixes to the inet sockets.

Mon Nov  5 22:07:17 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

Mon Nov  5 20:17:15 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised networking section of configuration system.

Wed Oct 31 22:29:50 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed details of two fixed bugs from BUGS.html file.
	* Regenerated BUGS file from revised BUGS.html file.

Mon Oct 29 18:26:24 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Brought RELNOTES up to date.

Mon Oct 29 13:12:49 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Completed contributors table from CHANGELOG entries.
	* Corrected mis-spelt email for Harry Kalogirou in CHANGELOG entry.
	* Spellchecked CHANGELOG using British English spellings throughout.
	* Updated TODO document to reflect targets for various releases.

Mon Oct 29 11:03:54 GMT 2001	Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com>.

	* Makefile patches to compile for SiBO.

Sat Oct 27 00:06:00 EEST 2001	Roman Festchook <roma@polesye.net>

	* Added the Russian FAQ to the Documentation.

Thu Oct 25 23:14:32 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated elks/BUGS to match elks/BUGS.html
	* Updated elks/INSTALLATION to match elks/INSTALLATION.html

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 23 17:36:10 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.88

	* Updated include/linuxmt/autoconf.h to match `make defconfig` results.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 23 01:44:24 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.88-PRE1.

	* Brought Makefile-rules up to date.
	* Removed includes for compile.h and version.h - sorry!
	* Preliminary version of documentation of Makefile structure added.

Mon Oct 22 14:22:41 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Corrected ELKS_VERSION_CODE calculation - it didn't work when
	  SUBLEVEL was 0, a case I forgot to test :(((
	* Removed requirement for compile.h and version.h as the relevant
	  values are now provided as defaults to all source code during the
	  compilation process.
	* Simplified creation of elks.spec for `make rpm` command (but this
	  command is not yet guaranteed to work).
	* Wrote design for revised Makefile system. Refer to the file
	  elks/Documentation/Makefile-structure.html for details.

Mon Oct 22 10:49:00 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug in net/Makefile spotted by Riley Williams.

Mon Oct 22 02:06:53 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed typos in recent CHANGELOG entries.
	* Thanks are due to Harry Kalogirou for sorting out the bug in the
	  Makefile's that I was unable to track down.

===============================================================================

Fri Oct 19 11:35:00 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.87.

	* Final changes for the release.

Thu Oct 18 17:32:06 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed `make dist` as it was stopping with error trying to create
	  the arch/i86 directory twice.
	* Fixed `make dist` to include keymap headers in the distribution.
	* Fixed `make dist` to include net/ipv4 directory in the distribution.

Thu Oct 18 16:53:02 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fix in Makefiles. The `make dep` command needs version.h and
	  compile.h to work.
	* Fixed arch/i86/mm/Makefile to make the tree compilable.

Wed Oct 17 11:32:57 CEST 2001	Arnaud Launay <asl@launay.org>

	* Updated my current email address.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 16 21:59:27 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.87-PRE1.

	* Reformatted ELKS_VERSION_CODE to reflect the actual use made of the
	  PRE's as being BEFORE the non-PRE version rather than after as was
	  previously assumed. Also allowed up to 255 PRE's between PATCHLEVEL
	  increments.
	* Bumped version to 0.0.87-pre1 in case anything is using the above
	  field.

Tue Oct  9 16:03:21 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted CHANGELOG to make it easier to find contributor's current
	  email addresses.
	* Created list of standard Makefile rules where all rules perform
	  exactly as documented.

Sun Oct  7 20:28:37 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `make tar` and skeletons for `make rpm` and `make deb` to base
	  Makefile.

Fri Oct  5 01:08:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed files created in compilation from CVS archive, and thus from
	  ELKS distribution set. These were elks/include/{compile,version}.h
	  which are both created anew as part of the compilation process.

Thu Oct  4 00:00:00 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed empty depend.awk and hfiles.sh from elks/scripts directory.
	* Tweaked elks/Makefile-rules to show my idea of how the Makefile
	  system ought to work. The aim is that the rules in here will be both
	  available and used by every Makefile in the tree.
	* Changed tag v0m0m73 to elks-0_0_73 to match other tags.

Wed Oct  3 23:37:43 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug introduced by my commit of 29 Sep 2001 and spotted by
	  Riley Williams earlier today.

Wed Oct  3 18:14:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to remaining Makefiles. There
	  appears to still be a bug in the reversion, which results in
	  as86 being called with bcc's parameters, but the rest is fixed.
	* Discovered bug in Harry Kalogirou's commit of 29 Sep 2001 and
	  reported it to him for sorting out.

Tue Oct  2 23:22:12 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added missing "### Dependencies:" tags to several Makefiles but
	  still to revert remaining Makefiles.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct  2 21:29:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.85-PRE3.

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to elks/Makefile previously.
	  Changes to other Makefiles in the tree still have to be reverted.
	* Added `make elks` rule to elks/Makefile - this will also be added to
	  all other Makefiles as I progress through the tree, and will have the
	  result of performing `make all` in the base directory independently
	  of the current location in the tree.
	* Changed method of calculating ELKS_VERSION_CODE and simplified it in
	  the process. The new method allows for 15 PRE's between sublevels,
	  instead of the 7 that previously existed.
	* Bumped version up to 0.0.85-pre3 to provide a marker for the previous
	  change. This is tagged both as V0-0-85-PRE3 and as elks-0_0_85-pre3
	  in CVS, the latter being the standard used for most other releases
	  from CVS as determined by inspection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Sep 29 13:47:47 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added locking of sock.avail_data that was previously omitted.
	* Changed Unix and nano sockets to use semaphores. Saved around 120
	  bytes of code.

Wed Sep 26 23:36:17 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Deleted redundant Makefile's from elks/Documentation sub-tree.
	* Added prototype rule to Makefile-rules to allow automatic conversion
	  of *.html to *.txt by Makefiles.

Sun Sep  9 09:56:25 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Accidentally committed Makefile tweaks as part of the Makefile
	  rationalisation that I started on 30 Aug 2001 that broke the
	  compilation of ELKS. This wasn't discovered until 26 Sep 2001.

	  The part of the rationalization that appears to have caused problems
	  is that of ensuring that ld86 was used throughout to generate the
	  *.a files from the collections of *.o files that were created by the
	  earlier rationalisation, rather than using a mixture of ld for some
	  and ld86 for others.

Sat Sep  8 22:33:39 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Prevented header files from being included more than once, as some
	  header files were not properly guarded against this.
	* Simplified current Makefiles by making use of `make -C` option.

Sat Sep  8 19:51:41 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `mkMake` script to scripts directory. This new file forms part
	  of the rationalisation of the ELKS Makefile system that I have been
	  undertaking, but does not impact on the current system in any way.
	  It is an important part of the rationalised Makefile system though,
	  so needs to be included.
	* Arranged Makefile such that `make elks` from ANY directory in the
	  ELKS source tree will compile the entire tree.

Thu Aug 30 19:16:22 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised ELKS Makefiles to use standard rule prototypes, with
	  elks/Makefile-rules containing all of the standard prototypes.

	  Basically, the rationalisation in question resulted in the ugly
	  mixture of using gcc to compile some *.c sources to *.s and bcc to
	  compile other *.c sources to *.s with either bcc or as86 used to
	  compile *.s to *.o (and some using bcc to compile directly to *.o
	  without going through the *.s intermediate stage) being changed to
	  use bcc from *.c to *.s and as86 from *.s to *.o throughout.

Tue Aug 28 11:43:35 BST 2001	Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com>

	* Patched ELKS CVS source to compile for SiBO.

Mon Aug 27 11:59:12 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed tcpdev.c to use semaphores now we have them.
	* Fixed bug in inet_read(). Should sleep again if woken up and has no
	  lock on the buffer.
	* Did some inet code cleanup
	* Some fixes to the TCP behaviour.

Mon Aug 27 08:24:38 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Unfolded prototype rules in Makefiles.

Sun Aug 26 21:22:43 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised elks/Makefile somewhat, ready for standardising the
	  Makefile rules throughout the ELKS source tree.

Sun Aug 26 10:54:19 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Clarified what is being incremented and decremented in sleepwake.c
	  up() and down() routines.

Sat Aug 25 23:32:20 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug in sleepwake.c . In down() *s-- was actually decreasing the
	  address with funny results!. Changed to --*s.

Fri Aug 24 18:23:54 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Made /dev/tcpdev return EBUSY if used.

Thu Aug 23 23:43:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed printout alignment error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c and also
	  offered apologies to Harry Kalogirou for the syntax error fixed below.
	* Reformatted CHANGELOG back to 80 columns.
	* Made `make dist` use the correct directory for pre-versions, and
	  simplified the creation of include/linuxmt/version.h in the process.

Wed Aug 22 23:25:57 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed syntax error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c

Wed Aug 22 21:35:29 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added the needed functionality to enable processes to get info and
	  configure the network. Look at the nettools directory in elkscmd.

Tue Aug 21 18:50:53 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed in scripts/Menuconfig and scripts/Configure a "linux"
	  leftover to "linuxmt" that caused configuration header file not
	  to be written.
	  
Tue Aug 21 18:09:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Whilst I was validating the printk() format strings, I came across
	  quite a few existing %o and %u format specifiers despite the fact
	  that neither was implemented until I added both types to printk()
	  earlier today.
	* Completed the validation of those files containing not more than
	  nine lines with printk() functions. Discovered several cases of
	  printk() formats without a terminating newline, so added such.
	* Found a panic() using a bad swear word, so changed it...

Tue Aug 21 17:23:40 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated strace.h and strace.c so all parameter types are printed
	  correctly, also added additional common parameter types to the list
	  of available parameter types.
	* Fixed a bug where an unknown syscall silently vanished.

Tue Aug 21 14:01:13 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added %o and %u types to printk() and redefined %d as signed.
	  Appropriate changes to printk calls will need to be made.
	* Reformatted syscall table in strace.c

Tue Aug 21 12:23:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Documented VT52 sequences listed in the VT100 User Guide. Others
	  probably exist that are only documented in the VT52 User Guide, but
	  I don't have access to that.

Tue Aug 21 11:33:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Created separate video directory for standalone video drivers.

	* Buffer cache and request queue now have segment data
	* Implemented segment stuff in the bios driver
	* Added the back end code (untested so far) for swapping
	* Replaced the wait queues with a V7 like wakeup mechanism with a bit
	  of auditing we should be ready to page kernel stacks of sleeping
	  processes that will free a fair bit of the data segment at the same
	  time as upping the task limit - still need to get stacks smaller
	  than 1K/task.
	* Made select work using a crude hash and the V7 like wakeups. May
	  need a bigger hash

	  disk or as auxiliary partition to transport new files over net into
	  the elks system. RAM_REDUCE reserves memory for that (at the moment
	  the segments 0x6000 and 0x7000 are used as disk to test this option.
	  This is defined in rd.c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Sep 25 12:37:30 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Sat Sep 26 01:50:30 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

Sat Sep 26 00:32:30 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>
	
	* "Fixed" Documentation/Configure.help so that help text

Fri Sep 25 15:30:45 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some bugs pointed out by Marnix Coppens <maco@telindus.be>
	* Changed code at 147 in arch/i86/mm/user.c in strlen_fromfs
	  which should use es:di to point to a string rather than ds:si.
	* Fixed code in fs/exec.c which uses file.f_op before it has been
	  checked.
	* Replaced code that clears bss in exec() to a call to fmemset() but
	  this did not work. fmemset() may be buggy.
	* Fixed chq_erase() so it zeroes len, not size, and ifdef'd it out.
	* Tweaked getch and addch so they deal with waiting in less code,
	  and modified checks for q->size - 1 into checks for q->size.
	* ifdef'd out chq_delch

Thu Sep 24 23:28:33 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed top level Makefile to make it clean up all dependency
	  stuff in all Makefiles. Should make it easier (no rejects) to
	  patch and diff stuff. 

Wed Sep 23 16:10:04 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h> in file
	  arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c. It doesn't matter for compilation
	  but it should be a kernel include file, right?

Wed Sep 16 20:20:20 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ANSI colour code; the
	  infinite loop would occur when faulty ANSI escape sequences
	  were fed to the kernel.
