	* Changed "toplevel" Makefile to make it clean up all
	  dependency stuff in all Makefiles. Should make it easier
	  (no rejects) to patch and diff stuff. 

Wed Sep 23 16:10:54 CEST 1998	Simon Weijgers	<mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h>
	  in file arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c.
	  It doesn't matter for compilation but it should be a kernel
	  include file right?

Wed Sep 16 20:20:00 CEST 1998	Simon Weijgers	<mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ansi color code;
	  the infinite loop would occur when faulty ansi escape
	  sequences were fed to the kernel.
