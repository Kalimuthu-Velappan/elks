Tue Oct 16 21:59:27 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted ELKS_VERSION_CODE to reflect the actual use made of
	  the PRE's as being BEFORE the non-PRE version rather than after
	  as was previously assumed. Also allowed up to 255 PRE's between
	  PATCHLEVEL increments.
	* Bumped version to 0.0.87-pre1 in case anything is using the
	  above field.

Tue Oct  9 16:03:21 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted CHANGELOG to make it easier to find contributor's
	  current email addresses.
	* Created list of standard Makefile rules where all rules perform
	  exactly as documented.

Sun Oct  7 20:28:37 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `make tar` and skeletons for `make rpm` and `make deb` to
	  base Makefile.

Fri Oct  5 01:08:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed files created in compilation from CVS archive, and thus
	  from ELKS distribution set. These were elks/include/compile.h
	  and elks/include/version.h which are both created anew as part
	  of the compilation process.

Thu Oct  4 00:00:00 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed empty depend.awk and hfiles.sh from elks/scripts directory.
	* Tweaked elks/Makefile-rules to show my idea of how the Makefile
	  system ought to work. The aim is that the rules in here will be
	  both available and used by every Makefile in the tree.
	* Changed tag v0m0m73 to elks-0_0_73 to match other tags.

Wed Oct  3 23:37:43 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug introduced by my commit of 29 Sep 2001 and spotted by
	  Riley earlier today.

Wed Oct  3 18:14:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to remaining Makefiles. There
	  appears to still be a bug in the reversion, which results in
	  as86 being called with bcc's parameters, but the rest is fixed.
	* Discovered bug in HarKal's commit of 29 Sep 2001 and reported it
	  to him for sorting out.

Tue Oct  2 23:22:12 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added missing "### Dependencies:" tags to several Makefiles but
	  still to revert remaining Makefiles.

Tue Oct  2 21:29:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.85-PRE3.

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to elks/Makefile previously.
	  Changes to other Makefiles in the tree still have to be reverted.
	* Added `make ELKS` rule to elks/Makefile - this will also be added
	  to all other Makefiles as I progress through the tree, and will
	  have the result of performing `make all` in the base directory
	  independantly of the current location in the tree.
	* Changed method of calculating ELKS_VERSION_CODE and simplified
	  it in the process. The new method allows for 15 pre's between
	  sublevels, instead of the 7 that previously existed.
	* Bumped version up to 0.0.85-pre3 to provide a marker for the
	  previous change. This is tagged both as V0-0-85-PRE3 and as
	  elks-0_0_85-pre3 in CVS, the latter being the standard used for
	  most other releases from CVS as determined by inspection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Sep 29 13:47:47 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added locking of sock.avail_data that was previously omitted.
	* Changed unix and nano sockets to use semaphores. Saved around
	  120 bytes of code.

Wed Sep 26 23:36:17 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Deleted redundant Makefile's from elks/Documentation subtree.
	* Added prototype rule to Makefile-rules to allow automatic
	  conversion of *.html to *.txt by Makefiles.

Sun Sep  9 xx:xx:xx BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Accidentally committed Makefile tweaks as part of the Makefile
	  rationalisation that I started on 30 Aug 2001 that appear to
	  have broken the compilation of ELKS. This wasn't discovered
	  until 26 Sep 2001.

	  The part of the rationalisation that appears to have caused
	  problems is that of ensuring that ld86 was used throughout to
	  generate the *.a files from the collections of *.o files that
	  were created by the earlier rationalisation, rather than using
	  a mixture of ld for some and ld86 for others.

Sun Sep  9 09:56:25 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Used `mkMake` script to initialise all missing Makefile's.

Sat Sep  8 22:33:39 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Prevented header files from being included more than once, as
	  some header files were not properly guarded against this.
	* Simplified current Makefiles by making use of `make -C` option.

Sat Sep  8 19:51:41 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `mkMake` script to scripts directory. This new file forms
	  part of the rationalisation of the ELKS Makefile system that I
	  am undertaking, but does not impact on the current system in any
	  way. It is an important part of the rationalised Makefile system
	  though, so needs to be included.
	* Arranged Makefile such that `make elks` from ANY directory in
	  the ELKS source tree will compile the entire tree.

Thu Aug 30 19:16:22 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised ELKS Makefiles to use standard rule prototypes, with
	  elks/Makefile-rules containing all of the standard prototypes.

	  Basically, the rationalisation in question resulted in the ugly
	  mixture of using gcc to compile some *.c sources to *.s and bcc
	  to compile other *.c sources to *.s with either bcc or as86 used
	  to compile *.s to *.o (and some using bcc to compile directly
	  to *.o without going through the *.s intermediate stage) being
	  changed to use bcc from *.c to *.s and as86 from *.s to *.o
	  throughout.

Tue Aug 28 11:43:35 BST 2001	Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com>

	* Patched ELKS CVS source to compile for SIBO.

Mon Aug 27 11:59:12 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed tcpdev.c to use semaphores now we have them.
	* Fixed bug in inet_read(). Should sleep again if woken up and has
	  no lock on the buffer.
	* Did some inet code cleanup
	* Some fixes to the tcp behavior.

Mon Aug 27 08:24:38 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Unfolded prototype rules in makefiles.

Sun Aug 26 21:22:43 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised elks/Makefile somewhat, ready for standardising the
	  Makefile rules throughout the ELKS source tree.

Sun Aug 26 10:54:19 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Clarified what is being incremented and decremented in sleepwake.c
	  up() and down() routines.

Sat Aug 25 23:32:20 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug in sleepwake.c . In down() *s-- was actualy decreasing the
	  address with funny results!. Changed to --*s.

Fri Aug 24 18:23:54 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Made /dev/tcpdev return EBUSY if used.

Thu Aug 23 23:43:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed printout alignment error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c and
	  offered apologies to HarKal for the syntax error fixed below.
	* Reformatted CHANGELOG back to 80 columns.
	* Made `make dist` use the correct directory for pre-versions, and
	  simplified the creation of include/linuxmt/version.h in the
	  process.

Wed Aug 22 23:25:57 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed systax error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c

Wed Aug 22 21:35:29 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added the needed functionality to enable processes to get info
	  and config the network. Look at the nettools directory in
	  elkscmd.

Tue Aug 21 18:50:53 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed in scripts/Menuconfig and scripts/Configure a "linux"
	  leftover to "linuxmt" that caused configuration header file not
	  to be writen.
	  
Tue Aug 21 18:09:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Whilst I was validating the printk() format strings, I came across
	  quite a few existing %o and %u format specifiers despite the fact
	  that neither was implemented until I added both types to printk()
	  earlier today.
	* Completed the validation of those files containing not more than
	  nine lines with printk() functions. Discovered several cases of
	  printk() formats without a terminating newline, so added such.
	* Found a panic() using a bad swear word, so changed it...

Tue Aug 21 17:23:40 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated strace.h and strace.c so all parameter types are
	  printed correctly, also added additional common parameter
	  types to the list of available parameter types.
	* Fixed a bug where an unknown syscall silently vanished.

Tue Aug 21 14:01:13 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added %o and %u types to printk() and redefined %d as signed.
	  Appropriate changes to printk calls will need to be made.
	* Reformatted syscall table in strace.c

Tue Aug 21 12:23:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Documented VT52 sequences listed in the VT100 User Guide.
	  Others probably exist that are only documented in the VT52
	  User Guide, but I don't have access to that.

Tue Aug 21 11:33:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Created separate video directory for standalone video drivers.
	* Created new VT52 directory to move existing kernel VT52 driver
	  into. I plan to get this working in usermode first, to help me
	  to learn how to do likewise with the ANSI driver.
	* Moved current ANSI video driver into video directory.

Tue Aug 21 10:30:24 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Second draft of ANSI driver.

Tue Aug 21 01:08:01 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* First draft of ANSI driver.

Mon Aug 20 09:01:05 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Prepare for writing of ANSI / VT100 druver as usermode by
	  creating directory ansi to do it in. This will compile as
	  a separate program, but is best kept in sync with the elks
	  kernel by being part of the same package.
	* Move Documentation/HTML/Technical/vt100.html to the ANSI
	  directory.

Mon Aug 20 08:22:34 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Second draft of Documentation/HTML/Technical/vt100.html

Mon Aug 20 01:22:32 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted and spellchecked various documents.
	* Added first draft of Documentation/HTML/Technical/vt100.html
	  which will document the requirements of a VT100 driver as
	  extracted from the Digital VT100 User Guide.

Fri Aug 17 17:43:14 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.85-PRE2.

	* Optimized character queue code.
	* Changed tty code to keep settings after every tty_open()
	* Added support for 57600 and 115200 bauds in serial driver.
	* Changed the Configure.help entry for CONFIG_INET.
	* Changed version to 0.0.85-pre2 and made a new release.

Tue Aug 14 22:18:01 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Revamped keymap system to make it easier to add new keymaps.

Tue Aug 14 10:46:47 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Added INSTALLATION document submitted on Linux-8086 mailing
	  list, after reformatting and HTML'ising.
	* Added README document submitted on Linux-8086 mailing list,
	  after reformatting.
	* Changed all vger.rutgers.edu to vger.kernel.org in above.
	* Added `renvar` script to scripts directory.

Mon Aug 13 22:58:15 BST 2001	Peter L Vachuska <pvachusk@nconnect.net>

	* Added DVORAK keyboard layout and options.

Mon Aug 13 18:50:50 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Renamed configuration variables such that all such variables
	  that are mentioned in the [Cc]onfig.in files now have names
	  beginning with CONFIG_ as per recommendations. This involved
	  remapping variable names as follows:

	GET_DISKPARAM_BY_INT13_NO_SEEK	CONFIG_HW_NO_SEEK_FOR_FLOPPY

	* Added HTMLised BUGS file, with updated details.

Fri Aug 10 23:38:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Reformatted TODO to fit in 80 columns.
	  Not sure if it's up to date though...
	* Reformatted BUGS to fit in 80 columns.
	  Not sure if it's up to date though...

Fri Aug  3 21:36:21 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Updated all files to refer to vger.kernel.org instead of to
	  vger.rutgers.edu as previously.

Sun Jul 29 19:44:58 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Reformatted CHANGELOG to 80 character lines, with standardised
	  layout throughout.
	* Corrected spelling in CHANGELOG.

Sun Jul  1 16:49:34 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added inet_select()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Jun 29 17:05:39 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@memalpha.cx>

	* Add CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, CONFIG_OBSOLETE and CONFIG_NOT_YET to
	  Documentation/Configure.help and arch/i86/config.in files ready
	  for use with other options.
	* Rationalise arch/i86/config.in to enable `make menuconfig` to
	  work - previously, it didn't.
	* Upgrade scripts/Configure and scripts/Menuconfig to the versions
	  included with the Linux 2.4.5 kernel source trees.

Tue Jun 26 01:18:57 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Semaphores made all inode downs block because sleeping when non
	  positive. Fixed to sleep on negative and wake on non negative.

Sun Jun 24 23:01:09 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* implemented do_mknod()
	* Some fixes in AF_UNIX sockets.
	* socket.state changed to unsighed char to solve compiler problems
	* Modified ntty.c and serial.c to support "raw" mode required for
	  networking
	* Now serial baud rate is set to the default on init and not open
	* tty_charout now blocks the right way if queue is full in ntty.c
	* Modified tty_read() in ntty.c
	* Merged in TCP/IP code
	* Fixed bug in do_select(). The new wait_set() expects
	  current->waitpt to be null. The do_select() didn't honor that.

Wed Jun 20 23:21:51 BST 2001    Alan Cox  <alan@redhat.com>

	* Merged fix for sycall.dat error I made (fix by Harry Kalogirou)
	* Merged Riley's first Configure changes

Mon Jun 18 00:18:55 BST 2001	Alan Cox  <alan@redhat.com>

	* Fixed bugs in the new tty select code
	* Added select to pty
	* Added register keywords to malloc.c to save memory
	* Fixed double indirection (> 512Kbytes) on minixfs

Sun Jun 17 19:47:58 BST 2001	Alan Cox  <alan@redhat.com>

	* Moved common code into minix_set_ops - based on a 2.4 change
	  from mainstream by Al Viro
	* Chop ltype down to 16 bytes - with our tiny stack 256 is crazy
	* Remove shlib stuff from fs/exec.c move file onto stack

Sun Jun 17 18:38 BST 2001   Alistair Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.84.

	* Resolved some minor clashes between Alan's commit and Thomas's
	  fix.
	* Bumped up version to 0.0.84 for release.

Sun Jun 17 11:20:06 BST 2001   Alan Cox  <alan@redhat.com>

	* Abolished the suid config option
	* Merged stuff to reduce the ifdef clutter a bit
	* Removed the nonexistant ip socket stuff. Its confusing having
	  all this old nonentity crap in it
	* Buffer cache and request queue now have segment data
	* Implemented segment stuff in the bios driver
	* Added the back end code (untested so far) for swapping
	* Replaced the wait queues with a V7 like wakeup mechanism
	  with a bit of auditing we should be ready to page kernel stacks
	  of sleeping processes that will free a fair bit of the data
	  segment at the same time as upping the task limit
	  - still need to get stacks smaller than 1K/task.
	* Made select work using a crude hash and the V7 like wakeups.
	  May need a bigger hash
	* Removed CONFIG_NOFS - just too ugly right now
	* Cleaned up random #if 0 stuff
	* Reformatted xt_key.c since it had bad tab/space damage
	* Killed bh->b_prev for good
	* Killed inode hash for good
	* Make off_t signed as required by Unix and Posix
	* Fix bogus scheduling during IRQ report
	* Fix link error about protocols
	* Clean up a lot of pointless define options
	* Remove BH stuff we definitely dont need
	* Add chq_full and fix select for write on tty interfaces
	* Shrink various minixfs messages to cut down on data segment
	* Note that the pipefs needs to be using minixfs blocks as per V7

Tue Apr 17 14:52 GMT 2001   Alistair Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Added dist rule to Makefiles.

Mon Apr  2 14:06 UTC 2001   Thomas McWilliams <tgm9999@yahoo.com>

	* Generate 8254 timer constants directly from definition of HZ.
	* Also some minor miscellaneous cleanups.

Sat Feb 26 19:23 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed bug in file descriptor macros which meant that
	  file descriptors > 7 did not work in select.

Sat Feb 26 13:02 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed socket code that deals with disconnections which was only
	  included for UNIX sockets, but is required by NANO sockets.

Fri Feb 25 15:05 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added swedish keyboard map submitted by Per Olofsson
	  (MagerValp@cling.gu.se).

Tue Feb 22 15:45 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Alterred default config to allow nano-X to run on standard
	  kernel.

Mon Feb 21 23:38 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Re-wrote tty input interrupt character code so it now
	works on serial ttys.

Fri Feb 19 19:38 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added raw keyboard mode for games support.

Mon Feb 14 10:25 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fix setting of effective uid and gid on suid and sgid
	  executables. Fix by Mario Frasca.

Fri Feb  4 18:37 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified buffer cache code so external 64K buffer cache can be
	  removed on systems with fast block device access and low RAM.

Thu Feb  3 17:40 GMT 2000   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Minor and cosmetic fixes to changes committed by Christoph
	  Plattner.

Wed Feb  2 2000  Christop Plattner  <Christoph.Plattner@dot.at>

	* init/main.c (init_task): use /dev/ttys0 instead of /dev/tty1
	  if serial console is used.
	* arch/i86/drivers/char/serial.c (port;): added function to setup
	  tty termios for the serial console.
	* (rs_init): rs_init checks now, if a serial port has been already
	  checked and setup by serial console initialization
	* (init_console): beside the rs_init() also the tty termios are
	  initialized und updated for the serial console port.

Wed Feb  2 2000  Christop Plattner  <Christoph.Plattner@dot.at>

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h> in file
	  arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c. It doesn't matter for compilation
	  but it should be a kernel include file, right?

Wed Sep 16 20:20 CET 1998   Simon Weijgers  <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ansi color code; the
	  infinite loop would occur when faulty ansi escape sequences
	  were fed to the kernel.
