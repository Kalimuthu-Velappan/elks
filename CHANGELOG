	* "Fixed" Documentation/Configure.help so that help text
	  fits in the menuconfig help-window line length.

Fri Sep 25 15:30 BST 1998   Alistair Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed a some bugs pointed out by Marnix Coppens <maco@telindus.be>

	  Changed code at 147 in arch/i86/mm/user.c in strlen_fromfs
	  which should use es:di to point to a string rather than ds:si.

	  Fixed code in fs/exec.c which uses file.f_op before it has been
	  checked.
	  Replaced code that clears bss in exec() to a call to fmemset() but
	  this did not work. fmemset() may be buggy.

	  Fixed chq_erase() so it zeroes len, not size, and ifdef'd it out.

	  Tweaked getch and addch so they deal with waiting in less code,
	  and modified checks for q->size - 1 into checks for q->size.

	  ifdef'd out chq_delch

Thu Sep 24 23:28 CET 1998   Simon Weijgers  <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed "toplevel" Makefile to make it clean up all
	  dependency stuff in all Makefiles. Should make it easier
	  (no rejects) to patch and diff stuff. 

Wed Sep 23 16:10 CET 1998   Simon Weijgers  <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h>
	  in file arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c.
	  It doesn't matter for compilation but it should be a kernel
	  include file right?

Wed Sep 16 20:20 CET 1998   Simon Weijgers  <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ansi color code;
	  the infinite loop would occur when faulty ansi escape
	  sequences were fed to the kernel.
