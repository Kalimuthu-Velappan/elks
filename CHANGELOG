	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ansi color code;
	  the infinite loop would occur when faulty ansi escape
	  sequences were fed to the kernel.

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h>
	  in file arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c.
	  It doesn't matter for compilation but it should be a kernel
	  include file right?
