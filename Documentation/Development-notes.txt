                 Development notes for new developers
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following topics are covered in this file:

 * Creating new directories.

 * Testing your patches before committing them.

==============================================================================

CREATING NEW DIRECTORIES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add any new directories to the ELKS tree, you can link them into the
standard versions of the standard make commands for ELKS by including the
following lines at the top of the Makefile you create in that directory:

	ELKSDIR		= ..

	ELKSSTD 	= Y

	CLEANDEP	= 

	CLEANME 	= 

	DEPEND		= 

	DISTFILES	= 

	include $(ELKSDIR)/Makefile-rules

The values on these lines MUST match the following descriptions:

	ELKSDIR 	The relative path from the directory the Makefile
			is in to the ELKS base directory. This is used
			extensively by the various ruiles, so MUST be
			accurate.

	ELKSSTD 	Whether to compile for ELKS or Linux. If this is
			set to 'N' it compiles for Linux, otherwise it
			compiles for ELKS.

	CLEANDEP	Any files in the current directory that the
			`make clean` command is dependent on.

	CLEANME 	Any files in the current directory to be removed
			by the `make clean` command that are not in the
			standard list of files matching "*~", "*.bak",
			"*.o", "*.map" or "*.tmp", or named "core". Also
			removed are any files matching "*.s" for which a
			"*.c" or "*.S" file also exists.

	DEPEND		Any files in the current directory that the
			`make dep` command is dependent on.

	DISTFILES	Any files in the current directory that are to
			be included in a distribution made with the
			`make dist` command that are not in the standard
			list. This standard list consists of those files
			NOT removed by `make clean` that match any of
			the patterns "*.?", "*.cc", "*.html", "*.in",
			"*.sh", "*.tk", "*.txt", "Makefile*" or "README*".

No other variables should be defined before including this file.

==============================================================================

TESTING YOUR PATCHES BEFORE COMMITTING THEM:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you commit changes to the CVS archive that prevent the CVS snapshot
from working, you will make yourself less than popular with those making
use of the CVS archive for development. You are strongly recommended to
always test your patches before committing them. Two commands have been
included in the base Makefile to facilitate this, as follows:

	make me 	Creates an exact copy of the current ELKS tree
			(including your patches) based in the directory
			../elks-tree relative to the current directory.

	make test	Attempts to run most of the standard commands in
			the following sequence:

				make dist
				mv $(DISTDIR) $(DISTDIR).pre
				make defconfig
				make clean
				make dep
				make Image
				make nbImage
				make dist
				mv $(DISTDIR) $(DISTDIR).post
				diff -ur $(DISTDIR).pre $(DISTDIR).post

You are strongly advised to make use of these before committing any major
changes to the CVS archive. In particular, do not commit anything to the
CVS archive if `make test` fails, or if
