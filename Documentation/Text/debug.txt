Here's a little document about how to build and debug the ELKS kernel... it's
probably going to be missing things for quite a while :)  

part 1: Setting up the build environment
----------------------------------------

	First, you should have the source tar for Dev86-0.14.5 or later.
Once you have both Dev86 and the latest ELKS sources, you're ready to start.

	You should untar Dev86, and the ELKS files (use
tar -xvzf _filename_ to unpack the tarfiles).

	Then, build the Dev86 libraries (all the defaults are fine), and
after you install it, go into the elks directory and enter 'make'.  If
all goes well, you will have your first ELKS kernel, configured identically
to the one provided as the bootdisk. 

part 2: Configuring your new ELKS kernel
----------------------------------------

	Usually, all you have to change is $/include/linuxmt/config.h to set
the rootdisk device.  For our purposes, set the rootdisk to 0x3c0 so you can
use the second floppy drive as the root device (this makes it fast).  Then 
rebuild the kernel.

part 3: MAKE (and run) ELKS FAST!
        (or, better hacking through dosemu)
-----------------------------------

	dosemu is extremely useful for shortening the edit/build/run cycle.
