    <a name="1.1"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.1">Q1.1. What is ELKS?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.1">ELKS is the Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset,
 a project to build a small kernel subset of Linux (which will provide more
 or less UNIX V7 functionality within the kernel) that can run on machines
 with limited processor and memory resources. More information on the background,
 goals and current status of the project can be found at the </a><a href="http://elks.sf.net/">
  ELKS home page</a>.</p>
          
  <p align="justify">The initial proposed targets are the Intel 8086 and eventually
the 286's 16-bit protected mode. A kernel that can run on this kind of hardware
is useful for embedded systems projects, for third world deployment where
80x86 x&gt;0 machines are not easily available, and for use on various palmtops.</p>
    <a name="1.2"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.2">Q1.2. How does ELKS compare with standard Linux?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.2">ELKS is intended to be a subset of true
 Linux, and ought to be small enough to be understood by one person, so it
 should be invaluable as a learning tool. ELKS recently entered the beta
development  state and most of it's functionality is there. &nbsp;</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.2">Having said that, it is already able to
 boot, provide virtual consoles, mount minix filesystems, provide basic serial
 and parallel I/O, connect to another computer over a null-modem SLIP link.
 Finally ELKS supports swapping to virtualy enlarge the system RAM.</a></p>
    <a name="1.3"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.3">Q1.3. Are there any ready-to-run distributions of ELKS?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.3">Not yet. You need to use a standard Linux
 machine, download the sources, and cross-compile to generate the 8086 target
 code.  Boot and root disk images are provided with the current version of
 ELKS,  but all they do is act as a platform for testing the system, and
very  little can be done with them.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify">If you are interested in building a distribution around
 ELKS, you are welcome.</p>
    <a name="1.4"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.4">Q1.4. Can ELKS run on an 8088?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.4">The 8088 is identical to the 8086, except
 it has an 8-bit external data bus instead of 16-bit (and thus is slower).
 So yes, ELKS will run on it.</a></p>
    <a name="1.5"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.5">Q1.5. What about the 80188 and 80186 processors?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.5">These are simply high-integration versions
 of the 8088 and 8086 respectively, so yes, ELKS will run on them.</a></p>
    <a name="1.6"></a>      
  <h4><a name="1.6">Q1.6. What about the NEC V20 and V30 processors?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="1.6">From a software viewpoint, these are simply
 8088 and 8086 processors respectively, with the sole exception that the
AAD  instruction can not be used with bases other than decimal on the V20
and V30, whereas it can be used with other bases on the 8088 and 8086 processors.
This difference will not prevent ELKS from running on these processors, and
it is believed that the kernel is not affected by this difference, but user 
 reports would be appreciated.</a></p>

  <h4><a name="2.2">Q2.2. How do I make an ELKS kernel?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">Recent releases contain a conmpiled binary
 kernel which most people whould be able to use for initial testing. You
should  only need to compile your own if you wish to modify the kernel, or
change  the configuration options. The file boot in images.zip can be written
to floppy with dd or RAWRITE.EXE to make a kernel boot disk.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">If you want to compile your own kernel,
 download <tt>dev86/Dev86-0.0.13.4.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>kernel/elks-0.0.67/elks-0.0.67.tar.gz</tt>
   (or the latest versions) from linux.mit.edu, or one of the other sites.
 Unpack Dev86 them into /usr/src (or any other convenient directory), and
elks into /usr/src/linux-86 then do...</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.2">	tar -xvzf Dev86-0.0.13.tar.gz -C /usr/src<br>	tar -xvzf elks-0.0.67.tar.gz -C /usr/src<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">The development environment will be created
 in /usr/src/linux-86, and the kernel source in /usr/src/elks. Next you have 
 to build the development tools, which include the <b>bcc</b> compiler:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.2">	cd /usr/src/linux-86<br>	make install<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">Next, compile the kernel:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.2">	cd /usr/src/elks<br>	# Build kernel<br>	make config<br>	make dep<br>	make<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">Make config works in the same way as the
 main Linux kernel. The default configuration will work on almost all systems.
 Don't change any of the options unless you know what you are doing.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">(If you're used to building Linux kernels
 with gcc, you'll be amazed at how quick this is! :-) The result is a floppy
 disk image called "Image", which you can copy to a formatted floppy and
boot  from.</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.2">	dd if=Image of=/dev/fd0<br></a></pre>

  <pre><a name="2.2">	make disk<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.2">You should now be able to boot with this
 disk, but you won't get much further without a root floppy disk for it to
 mount. You can either use the image file root provided in images.zip, or
make your own. You'll need to use bcc to compile an 'init' program and make
a root minix filesystem. This is explained further down.</a></p>

  <h4><a name="2.4">Q2.4. How do I make an 'init' for ELKS?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.4">After the ELKS kernel has booted it will
 run /bin/init. A real version of 'init' is being prepared for inclusion
in  the tiny-utils package, also on linux.mit.edu. A very basic init and
login  is included in the sysutils part of the elkscmd package which is distributed
 with each release. The kernel code has recently been changed so that it
loads  /bin/init instead of /bin/sh.</a></p>

 both with...</a></p>

   <code>-s   </code> strips symbols out of the binary.</a></p>

 of your root disk. The login program requires an /etc/passwd and a /etc/group
 file, and a /bin/sh (or other depending on the entry in /etc/passwd.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.4">As of kernel 0.0.56 sash now works and
 is being used as /bin/sh by most people. It can be found in elkscmd.tar.gz.
 For best results copy /etc/passwd and /etc/group from a standard linux distribution 
 onto your root disk so that ls -l works okay, and /usr/lib/liberror.txt so
 that sash error reporting works.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.4">A version of ash is also included which
 does work under ELKS, but is much larger, and may not work at all on machines
 with &lt;640K of memory.</a></p>

  <h4><a name="2.5">Q2.5. How do I make a root filesystem disk?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.5">For most people the root filesystem included
 in images.zip should be ideal, and can be used to create a root disk under 
 Linux as follows:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.5">	dd if=root of=/dev/fd0 bs=8192<br></a></pre>

  <p align="justify"><a name="2.5">You need to create a minix floppy containing
 the appropriate bits and pieces. This file should contain init, login, and
 sh in /bin/ and passwd and group in /etc/, as well as three ttys for init
 in /dev/.</a></p>

  <p align="justify"><a name="2.5">Some distributions use /dev/fd0u1440 instead
 of /dev/fd0H1440. You should removed passwords from the passwd file as they 
 are not yet suported, and make sure the shell entry for each user is /bin/sh
 for future compatability.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.5">Alternatively, if you have a 2.0.x kernel
 and mount-2.5k, you can use the loopback filesystem to create a disk image
 on your hard disk, and then dump it to floppy:</a></p>

  <p align="justify"><a name="2.5">As of ELKS 0.0.53 floppy sizes other than
 1.44M now work. Just follow the above intructions substituting the appropriate
 sizes in where required. However, because of the way 360K disks are written
 by 1.2Meg drives, the instructions below must be followed if you are trying 
 to boot a machine with a 360K drive.</a></p>

on a different machine requires a little care, especially if the target machine
 has a 360K drive. 360K drives (5.25" DD) have 40-track heads, and 1.2MB
(5.25"  HD) have 80-track heads. A 1.2MB drive can read 360K disks but not
reliably  write them, since it will write magnetic tracks which are half
the width expected by a 360K drive.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">One solution is to fit a 360K drive as
 the second drive in your Linux PC - you can then format 360K disks with...</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.6">	fdformat /dev/fd1d360<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">...and create filesystems as usual.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">Otherwise, you will need to create a floppy
 disk image file, transfer it to the PC which has the 360K drive (e.g. using
 a serial cable), then use "rawrite" under DOS to recreate the disk from
the  image file.</a></p>
          
  <h4><a name="2.6">Boot disks</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">The 'Image' file can be written to any
 type of floppy disk and will boot successfully, so all you need to do is
transfer the file and use 'rawrite' to make the target disk.</a></p>

  <h4><a name="2.6">Root disks</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">You can prepare a 360K root image on a
 larger drive - when you enter the mkfs command substitute '360' for the
size  of the filesystem. Once you have copied the files to this disk, unmount
it,  then you can create a disk image file from it:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.6">	dd if=/dev/fd0 of=root.image bs=1k count=360<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.6">This image can then be transferred to
the target and written out using 'rawrite' as before. If you use the loopback
 filesystem this step is not necessary.</a></p>

  <p align="justify"><a name="2.7">Version 0.0.62 boot disk was compiled
to use the second floppy drive as a root disk because the wait_for_keypress()
 function was broken. You can get round this if you only have one floppy
drive  by using a hex editor to change the root device no. in the image.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.7">If you get an error about root disk mount
 failing on device 03c0, load the boot image into a hex editor and look for
 c003h somewhere near the start of the image and change it to 8003h. (c003h
 is 03c0 in Intel's backwards byte ordering). This should work for any version,
 but it is not clear whether the address of the byte to edit varies between
 version. </a><a href="MailTo:jose@cnct.com">jose@cnct.com</a> reports that

  <h4><a name="2.8">Q2.8. How do I install to ELKS to harddisk?</a></h4>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">As of version 0.0.65 it is possible to
 install ELKS root disk on a harddisk and then create a boot floppy that
uses  this. There still some bugs but it is more usable than a root floppy.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">First create a partition with fdisk. Any
 version of fdisk will be able to do this, but the current root disk only
supports bd?1-4, which are primary partitions, and if you already have a
DOS primary partition you will not be able to make a second primary partition
with DOS fdisk. The version of fdisk included on the ELKS 0.0.67 root disk
is still young code, but seems to work fine on my system.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">Having created the partition, boot ELKS
 from boot and root floppies, and create a filesystem using mkfs. It is safe

 you want to create the filesystem on. To create the filesystem type...</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.8">	mkfs /dev/bd?? &lt;size&gt;<br></a></pre>

 and size is the size of the partition in Kbyte blocks. &lt;size&gt; cannot
 be more than 32M. E.g. To make a filesystem on the first partition on the
 slave disk, which is a 20M partition type:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.8">	mkfs /dev/bdb1 20000<br></a></pre>

  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">...where <i>bd??</i> is the correct partition.
 The root directory of the new partition may look a bit corrupted and it
may  not be possibly to use ls from /mnt. I am not sure why mkfs is generating 
 slightly corrupt filesystems, but I am working on it.</a></p>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">Create the essential directories on the
 new filesystem as follows:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.8">	cd /mnt<br>	mkdir bin dev etc home mnt root<br>	mkdir usr usr/lib<br>	mkdir var var/log var/run<br>	mkdir /mnt/home/user?....<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">Now copy essential files. You will need
 many more than these for a decent system but here are the essentials and
some of the more useful ones:</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.8">	cd /bin<br>	cp -v cp init getty login ls mount pwd sh umount /mnt/bin/<br>	cd /etc<br>	cp -v group passwd /mnt/etc/<br>	cp /usr/lib/liberror.txt /mnt/usr/lib/<br>	touch /mnt/var/run/utmp<br></a></pre>

  <pre><a name="2.8">	cd /mnt/dev<br>	for N in 0 1 2 3 ; do mknod tty$N c 4 $N ; done<br>	mknod fd0 b 3 128<br>	mknod fd1 b 3 192<br>	for N in '' 1 2 3 4 ; do mknod bda$N b 3 $[$N+0] ; done<br>	for N in '' 1 2 3 4 ; do mknod bdb$N b 3 $[$N+64] ; done<br>	cd /<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">Now unmount the new partition with</a></p>
          
  <pre><a name="2.8">	umount /dev/bd??<br></a></pre>
          
  <p align="justify"><a name="2.8">You will now need to re-compile a new
kernel with the correct root device selected. To do this edit include/linuxmt/config.h
 in the ELKS kernel sources, and changed the CONFIG_ROOTDEV from 0x380 to
the device number of the partition. The last two digits must be the minor
 number of the partition in hex. The minor number can be found from the list
above in the far right column. E.g. The minor number for bdb3 is 67, which
is 43 in hex, so the ROOT_DEV value is 0x343.</a></p>
